    DIY uses a custom typeface called <strong>Apex Rounded</strong>, a stylized 
    typface that helps express a friendly personality. The Medium face is used 
    for large headlines and interactive elements, as overuse can skew 
    too young-feeling.

    Helvetica is used for dynamic or user-generated copy to create a clear 
    distinction between when the voice is coming from DIY or a user on the site. 
    It also makes it clear which elements are part of the interface.

<p>
    Headings should be used to structure a document's hiearchy. 
    To provide flexibility in how a heading is styled from it's placement in 
    the document heading classes are used in place of 
    styling heading elements directly.

    This tool bag is the perfect place to store your ever-growing tool 
    collection and makes easy work of carrying your gear from the workshop to 
    the job site. A lot of pros choose canvas tool bags over metal boxes for 
    their lighter weight and their ability to <a href="#">@drk</a> be hung on 
    hooks and ladders. Don't be afraid to get this bag dirtyâ€”it only looks 
    better with age!

    This huge blanket is a great way to show off your patch collection. It's 
    ideal for winter camping, cabin bedding, or a day adventure. This blanket 
    is heavyweight, so for a <a href="#">#backpacking</a> trip you'll want 
    something lighter. It's also flame retardant and machine washable.
